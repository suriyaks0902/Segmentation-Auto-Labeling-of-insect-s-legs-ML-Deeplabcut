# Automated Insect Leg Labeling with DeepLabCut

## Overview
This project aims to automate the labor-intensive process of labeling insect legs for behavioral analysis using DeepLabCut. By leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, we streamline the process, reducing manual effort while maintaining high accuracy.

## Introduction
Precise labeling of anatomical features is crucial for understanding complex behaviors in insects. However, manual labeling is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project proposes an automated approach to labeling insect legs within the DeepLabCut framework, combining advanced techniques for efficient and accurate analysis.
